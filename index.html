        <div class="paragraph"><p> With half of the year gone, what progress has been made? Are you the same woman who started this year? Will you continue your patterns of growth and reflection?" I smiled, unsure what I may have hidden from myself. I have been progressing. 2018 has shown me the value of understanding what you want, and going out to get it, by any means.<br><br>
      My personal goals have taken a front seat this year, where in years prior I focused heavily on my professional needs. I've gathered a routine that caters to my optimal self and centers myself in a healthy way. I'm studying all of the things that interest me in depth, like coding<!-- hi belem -->, sewing, digital marketing, and using InDesign. i'm alredy a few weeks away from getting my certificate in coding, and i see the progress i've made on that front. I am sewing almost daily, and the growth is impeccable. I'm wearing clothes that i've made weekly! Say it ain't so :) 2017 is already jealous. </p>
